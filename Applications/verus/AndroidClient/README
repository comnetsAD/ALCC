We rewrote verus_client.cpp and verus.hpp in verus project (https://github.com/yzaki/verus)
with Java language in Android Studio to bring it to all Android devices.

With this program users can directly run verus client to communition with normal verus server to get 
some test datas whth mobile devices which use cellur network.

You can download source code of VerusAndroid and use Android Studio to imports 'Project' folder.
Build this program with Android Studio yourself and create app for your Android devices.

In the other hand, we also provide a pre-build version apk file.
